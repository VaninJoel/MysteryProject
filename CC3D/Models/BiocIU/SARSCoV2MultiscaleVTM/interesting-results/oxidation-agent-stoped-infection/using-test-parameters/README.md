# Infection stopped by oxidation agent

Immune cells when activated and exposed to a cytokine field > threshold (here a low testing value
was used, value is not based on anything). Most killed lung cells are killed by the 
agent (seen on top left image in red). Non-infected cells were also killed by the oxidation
agent. After the infection was dealt with (all infected cells killed, all virus dead)
oxidation agent production carried on until the cytokine field decayed enough, killing more 
uninfected cells.
